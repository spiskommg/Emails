Dear \{{lead.First Name}},
<br><br>
We were a little too excited about our recent Organic Stevia In The Raw and Costco promotion and accidentally e-mailed the information to you even though this particular promotion is not available in your area.
<br><br>
For other ways to save on better-for-you products, visit our Coupon Center to check out over a dozen available money-saving deals.
<br><br>
Thank you and our apologies,
<br><br>
The Moms Meet Team
